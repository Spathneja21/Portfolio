Developed an end-to-end machine learning system to automate diamond pricing using a dataset of 53,940 records. 
After rigorous data cleaning, deduplication, and outlier removal, I engineered a pipeline to evaluate 7 regression and 8 classification models. XGBoost emerged as the top performer for both tasks, achieving a 98.11% R2 score for price prediction and 96.01% accuracy for quality classification. The suite included diverse architectures from Linear Regression and SVMs to MLP Neural Networks. 

To conclude the lifecycle, I deployed the optimal regression model into a Streamlit web application, providing real-time, data-driven valuations for the gemstone industry.
